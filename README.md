# CODING PROJECTS
The folders and files contained in this repository represent the work undertaken by myself, Mohammad Askari, 
during my 4 year integrated Masters Degree at the University of Sheffield, to study C, MATLAB, Python and other related languages. 

Of particular note within these folders is the "Projects in C" folder, which contains:
1. All of the problem sheets I completed during my course, learning the programming language C (contained in "Problem Sheets")
2. All files related to the robot project I completed in my second year, using C to code an autonomous robot to navigate a foreign area,
   detecting and moving around obstacles (contained in "Robot Project")
3. A Choose Your Own Adventure Game I coded as part of one of my module's final assignments, which uses a series of nested loops to guide the user
   through a fictional narrative, with their choices affecting parameters such as stats, items/weapons, etc. as well as the story (contained in
   "ChooseYourOwnAdventureGame.c")

As well as this, the "FinalYearProjectinMATLAB" folder contains my all MATLAB code related to my final year dissertation, which involved the coding
and simulation of a digital twin for a 3m wingspan VTOL UAV, which I led the manufacturing and design of in a student drone project, coordinating the
efforts of 40 other engineering students as Project Lead. The files contain MATLAB scripts which ran alongside my final model, simulating the avionics
system of the drone (all key electronics, including battery, pwoer distribution and motors) as well as their effects on overall flight performance
when certain parameters were varied, to gauge the optimal flight configuration. 

Thanks again for the opportunity to interview, I hope these descriptions were helpful and do let me know if you have any further questions!
